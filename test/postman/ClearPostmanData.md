clear the test data from postman test completed!
info: Done!
```
## Strategy
1. Setup the `AUTOMATED_TESTING_NAME_PREFIX` from the test environment. This prefix should be a name that will never be used 
set as part of the role name. e.g. 'POSTMANE2E-'. In this case, the created `ResourceRole` will have a name like 'POSTMANE2E-submitter'.

2. You can use use Postman's mock server for the bus api. You can refer to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXMzyqpzwix-LDBwieiRFfpJlJxrTIgI/view?usp=sharing
   for details. You need to update the environment variable `BUSAPI_URL` to your Postman mock server.
  
3. Steps of clearing the test data from Postman tests.
   * Find all `ResourceRole` record whose names are starting with `AUTOMATED_TESTING_NAME_PREFIX`.
   * For each `ResourceRole` record, find all `ResourceRolePhaseDependency` records whose `resourceRoleId` are the same 
     as the `id` of `RecourceRole`. Delete those `ResourceRolePhaseDependency` records.
   * For each `ResourceRole` record, find all `Resource` records whose `roleId` are the same
     as the `id` of `RecourceRole`.
     * Delete those `Resource` records.
     * Delete the ES index by the resource id too. (Only **Resource** are indexed by ES.)
   * Delete the `ResourceRole` record.

4. Note, in production enviroment, there is no need to run `npm run init-es force` or `npm run init-db`.

## Questions from the spec
* The DB is getting filled up with dummy/test data. You need to suggest a way to delete/clean up the data created from executing the tests without affecting existing data.  
  _Check above strategy section._
* Lookup data may not be required to get created as it may already exist or in some cases must not get created as there will be conflicts with existing data. You need to suggest how to overcome this issue.  
  _All data from the Postman tests can be easily deleted._
* Existing lookup data should not be deleted. You need to suggest how to avoid accidentally deleting lookup data.  
  _The Postman tests only use the testing data created by itself._
* Existing production data should not be affected by the tests. You need to suggest how to avoid this possible issue.  
  _Check the strategy section. All testing data are removed at last._
* If possible, we should be able to differentiate the test data from the actual data so we can filter it out from the search results of the production API. Please suggest how to achieve this.  
  _Check the strategy section. We can easy find all `ResourceRole` records with the given role name prefix. Then we can find all the related `ResourceRolePhaseDependency` and `Resource`._
